# Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch


This repository contains code for the [O'Reilly Live Online Training for Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch
](https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-pytorch/0636920086096)

This training provides the theory, practical concepts, and comprehensive introduction to machine learning and deep learning with PyTorch. By making your way through several real-world case studies including object recognition and text classification, this session is an excellent crash course in deep learning with PyTorch.

We will use tools including large pre-trained models and model training dashboards to set up reproducible deep learning experiments and build machine learning models optimized for performance. There will be several code examples throughout the training to help solidify the theoretical concepts that will be introduced.
